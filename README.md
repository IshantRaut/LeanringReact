# Introduction to React

React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, especially single-page applications. It allows for component-based development and efficient updates through a virtual DOM.

# Conditional Rendering

Conditional rendering in React means rendering components or elements based on certain conditions. It can be achieved using JavaScript logical operators, ternary operators, or the && syntax.

# Handling Events

Handling events in React is similar to handling DOM events in vanilla JavaScript, but with some syntax differences. You use camelCase for event names and pass a function as the event handler.


# React Router DOM

React Router DOM is used for navigating between pages in a React application. It provides components like <BrowserRouter>, <Routes>, <Route>, and <Link> for defining routes.


# useState Hook

The useState hook allows you to add state to functional components. It returns a state variable and a function to update it.


# useEffect Hook

The useEffect hook is used for side effects like data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM in functional components.


# useRef Hook

The useRef hook is used to reference DOM elements or store mutable variables that persist across renders without causing re-renders.
